    Real Flow Geometry Export SOP
    The Real Flow SD File Export SOP will export Houdini
    geometry to Real Flow SD (Scene Description) files including animated objects.
    You can also export any set of points from
    Houdini as Real Flow particle BIN2 files.
    All Real Flow attributes in the geometry will be written to
    the file if present in the geometry.  This SOP supports multiple inputs

@inputs

Geometry to Export:

     The geometry to export to Real Flow

@parameters

== Setup Tab ==

    File Name:

     The name of the Real Flow file to save. (for BIN2 particle file, the frame number is appended to the file name)

    File Format:

        'Select the type of Real Flow file to export'

        *SD file*   Scene file

        *Real Flow Particles* particles

        *RW Cache* Real Wave Cache



    Animated (for SD files only):

     If checked, the exported Real Flow SD file will
     contain animation information for the exported geometry over the
     desired range of frames as set in the \"Start/End\" fields.

    Start/End:

     The frame range to export to the Real Flow file.

    Echo Data to Console (debug):

     If checked, the geometry being processed
     will be echoed to the system console for debugging purposes.
     This is helpful for determining if the incoming geometry
     is in fact triangular polygon geometry (be careful, for complex
     geometry, this can slow your computer for some time).

    __Write the SD File__:

     When pressed, the Real Flow SD file will be written to disk.



== SD File Tab ==

    Object Color:

    The color of the object to be exported in the SD file.

    Mode:

    The mode the SD file is exported as, matrix or vertex.  Vertex mode
    will includeing deforming geometry data in the SD file


== Particle File Tab ==

     Fluid Name

    	The name of the fluid being exported.

     Fluid Type

        The type of Real Flow fluid: Gas, Liquid, Dumb, Elastics

     Frames/Sec

        The frame rate: 24/25/30

     Scene Scale

        The scene scale in Real Flow

     Particle Radius

        The radius of the particles being exported to Real Flow

     Pressure (Min, Max, Avg)

        The pressure bounds and average of the particles.

     Speed (Min, Max, Avg)

        The speed bounds and average of the particles.

     Temperature (Min, Max, Avg)

        The temperature bounds and average of the particles.

     Emitter Position

        The position coordinates for the particle emitter.


    <w:include href="standard" idref="valid_frame_range"/>

    SOP Path

        The SOP node which contains the points used to write the file.

    Output File

        Name of the BIN file to write.

    File Type

        File type to export: BIN or Proxy.

    Scale

        Specifies a scale on the geometry before written out.

    Relative Time Values

        If set, time values will be written out relative to the starting frame.

        TIP

            To import an MDD file that was saved with this option enabled, the
            _Frame_ parameter of the [Node:sop/rf_particle_export] surface node should use the
            expression `$FF+1-`_start frame_ instead of `$FF`. For sequences
            starting at frame 1 though, this is not necessary.

    Initialize Simulation OPs

        Force all simulation OPs to be reset. This includes DOP
        Networks, POP SOPs, and other OPs that cache their results.

        This is the safest way to render out a simulation, because it
        starts the simulation from scratch and discards any partial
        simulations you might have done with different parameters.

@locals

    N

        The current frame of the range specified. This always starts at 1.

    NRENDER

        Total number of frames being rendered.
